# SHRUB - *S*upport *H*elper *R*esponsive *U*tility *B*ot

**SHRUB** is a customer service bot that interacts with a customer to help them navigate questions they may have about a product or service.  In this demo, the bot is configured to answer low-level technical support questions by referencing an FAQ.  SHRUB is built using the [IBM Watson API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developer/), with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

This project is currently in development.  Backend is located at https://github.com/tardisdriver/cust-support-ai-chat-BE.

**MVP Stories**
As a customer:     
  -I want the bot to validate my account as quickly as possible so that I can get my question answered fast.       
  -I want to chat with the bot in a way that I am accustomed to, like within an instant/direct message or SMS, so that I feel comfortable using the bot.      
  -I want to be able to get the answer I need as quickly as possible so that I don't have to wade through FAQs on my own.
